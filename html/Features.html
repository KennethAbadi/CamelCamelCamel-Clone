                <h2>Price History Charts</h2>
                <p>Price history charts are another major part of DromedaryDromedaryDromedary. Every product page contains graphs of the price variations over time for each of the three price types, as
                    well as the high/low/average prices. Price and availability data is updated from Amazon constantly to ensure it is as accurate as possible, but should always be checked
                    on Amazon before making a purchase.</p>

                <h2>Registration</h2>
                <P>
                    Signing up for things is a pain in the neck, so DromedaryDromedaryDromedary makes it completely optional. You don't even have to give your email address to track products, although
                    it helps if you want to receive email alerts. If you don't, you can simply add the price watch's RSS feed to your newsreader and await the alerts patiently.
                </p>   
                
                <p>
                    If you do choose to sign up or receive email alerts, rest assured that I will not sell or distribute your information to anyone without your consent.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Those brave souls who take the plunge -- much like Bastian in the Neverending Story 2 -- and register receive access to the Camel Management and Wishlist Importer
                    tools, which are very useful and look good on your resume. Any price watches created prior to your registration, using the same email address, will be moved over to your
                    account as we check them for pricing updates. This may take up to 8 hours or so, and they will appear to trickle in.
                </p>

                <h2>Price Search</h2>
                <p>
                    Search is accessed via the box at the top right of every page, or by clicking "Amazon Products" in the menu at the top of the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Search results are displayed tabularly and, amongst other things, contain the Amazon/New/Used prices and links to price history RSS feeds for each price type, which
                    are useful if you'd rather not actually create a price watch.
                </p>

                <h2>Item Filters</h2>
                <p>
                    To help you keep track of your price watches, there are a number of filters available--which remain active until disabled or you logout--to help refine the list, as follows:
                </p>
        
                <p>
                   <b>Status</b> - is your price watch active (woot, the price you want!), updated, unchanged, or perhaps new?
                   <br> <b>Price Type</b> - there are three price types available for your tracking needs: Amazon, Third Party New and Third Party Used prices. You can track one or all three!
                   <br><b>Category</b> - this filter is based on the Amazon category of your tracked products.
                   <br><b>Artist</b> - as a music fan I thought it would be nice to list the artists (with picture!) of any musical price watches you might have.
                   <br> <b>Product Name</b> - the first letter of every product you're tracking is made into a filter option.
                </p>
